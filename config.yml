        <p class="profile-greeting">Hi, I'm Alice 👋</p>
        <br>
        <p>I'm a PhD student in Sociology and Methodology of Social Research at the Universities of Milan and Turin, and a member of the <b>spsTREND</b> public opinion research lab. I study how young people imagine and navigate their paths into adulthood, especially in a world shaped by uncertainty, inequality, and shifting social norms.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My PhD project, <b>Adulthood in the Making</b>, explores how Italian adolescents picture their futures — and how gender, emotions, and broader structural conditions shape their expectations around family, autonomy, and what it even means to "be an adult" today. To do this, I use an explanatory mixed-methods design that blends national survey data with in-depth interviews, because I love combining numbers and narratives to understand the stories behind the statistics.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Beyond that, I'm very interested in <b>youth transitions</b>, <b>youth political participation</b>, and the inequalities that shape who gets to participate, especially in online spaces. Methodologically, I'm a big fan of mixed methods and the possibilities they open up for studying young people's lives.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you want to chat about youth, transitions, politics, methods, or anything in between, feel free to email me, I'm always happy to connect.</p>
